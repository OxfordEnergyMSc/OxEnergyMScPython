# Welcome to your first Spyder file!
# Follow the tutorial to learn
# more about this coding environment


# Here is a sample line of code where we DEFINE a variable:
test_variable = 2 + 2

# Run the line above and see what happens in each
# display window (try figuring out how to run that individual line)

# Run the following now:
test_variable

# Sometimes Spyder will warn you about errors
# or ways to improve your script.

# E.g.:
test_variable = 2 +

# Hover over the x symbol

# Properly commenting on your code is vital!
# For instance, would you easily know what is being done below?:

MWhpyr = [0];
MWhpyr[0] = 2*24*365;

# With inefficient code like the lines above, commenting helps with 
# optimisation, particularly within research groups

Challenge (complete and submit entire Spyder file)

# Let's get a bit deeper with lists. Here is what you will need to show in
# in your code below (well commented!):
    
#   1) Create a Python 'list' of 10 renewable energy fuel sources (wind, solar etc)
#   2) Use that list variable to 'print' the 4th fuel type
#   3) Assign the 5th fuel type to a variable called "fifth"
#   4) 'print' the statement "The 5th fuel type in the created list is 
#      <insert fuel type> and the fuel type with the most characters is
#      <insert fuel type>".

Number 4 is going to be the most challenging and will require a bit of Googling
but ... that's the point. Coding involves a LOT of research and this will be 
a good skill to have. Sites like Stack Overflow will become your best friend!
